  # ⚠️ CRITICAL: POST-DEPLOYMENT MANUAL STEP REQUIRED ⚠️
  #
  # After the RDS instance is created and the Elastic Beanstalk environment is
  # up, you MUST manually set PARSE_SERVER_DATABASE_URI or the application will
  # NOT be able to connect to the database and will fail to function.
  #
  # Run the following command from your project directory:
  #   eb setenv PARSE_SERVER_DATABASE_URI="postgres://parseuser:YOUR_PASSWORD@RDS_ENDPOINT:5432/ebdb"
  #
  # You can get the RDS endpoint from:
  #   eb printenv | grep RDS_HOSTNAME
  #
  # This step is required even if you used a one-click or CloudFormation-based
  # deployment; it must be performed AFTER the environment and RDS instance
  # have been created.
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # WARNING: MultiAZDatabase is set to false for cost savings. For HIPAA compliance
  # and production deployments, set this to true for high availability.
